1. In playbooks we mainly have Target,Variable and Task sections
2. Here we are using Target and tasks no need for variables section
3. We create ansible account on all the machines whose states need to be configu red so we can easily ssh into those machines.
4. once getting into the machne we are installing apache-tomcat and after that using handler we are restarting incase if it is not restarted.

5. for large playbooks we can use roles where in each section like target/variable/handler etc are kept in seperate folders and are included using roles section in main.yml file.
